                "For the VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2, I focused on analyzing the disappearance of GAStech employees by leveraging geospatial and transaction data. My role involved creating a graphical analytics system that included seven visualizations designed to uncover patterns of suspicious behavior among employees. Using D3.js and Python Flask, I implemented features like a symbol map, stacked bar charts, and heat maps to visualize movement and transaction data effectively. I also optimized data processing to enhance responsiveness, ensuring that complex queries could be addressed efficiently. This project not only honed my skills in data visualization but also deepened my understanding of geospatial analysis and its practical applications in real-world scenarios."

The application dynamically manages resources by scaling up or down the number of processing instances based on the volume of incoming user requests. Key AWS services utilized include EC2 for computation, SQS for message queuing, and S3 for storage, while OpenStack is used to create a private cloud infrastructure. The web app is designed with three main components: a web tier for handling user requests, a controller to manage auto-scaling, and an app tier that processes image recognition tasks. Auto-scaling ensures that the system can handle varying loads efficiently by launching or terminating instances as needed.",
                "The project demonstrates how cloud infrastructure can be optimized to manage workloads dynamically, ensuring cost efficiency and resource availability. The team also implemented a caching mechanism to reduce response times and enhanced the auto-scaling logic to overcome issues like inconsistent queue reporting and unnecessary polling of SQS queues. This application provides a practical solution for handling high-traffic workloads in a cloud environment, showcasing key concepts of hybrid cloud computing, image processing, and resource optimization."

The key challenge addressed was class imbalance, with 75% of the data representing normal heartbeats. Data augmentation and reduction techniques were applied for fairness. 1D-CNN proved most effective, achieving high accuracy and recall in classifying arrhythmia types, offering a robust solution for real-time ECG signal analysis."

These sentiments are modeled in a graph database to study user behavior, establish connections, and understand trends in public opinion. Machine Learning techniques, including SVM and LSTM, are employed to classify sentiment and categorize tweets across topics like education, politics, and sports. This analysis can be applied in fields such as advertising, mental health monitoring, and customer sentiment analysis."
